Personal Website

This is my personal website. If you have questions to some topics i would appreciate
if you use the Disqus commenting system on my site. But you also can create an Issue
if that is not an option for you.

As i don't claim that everything that i write is correct, you also can create an issue
if you found an error. You also can create Pull Requests if you found broken or defect
code. For this kind of errors i also appreciate Issues.

As i'm not a native English speaker, and i'm also not claiming that my english is
very good, you also can create issues or give some general advice.

But overall don't create Pull Requests that completely change a blog entry, adds
a ton of additional text, or removes a lot of stuff. As i will not merge those
requests. The same goes for full blog entries not written by me. I don't do
any kind of "guest blogs" or something like that.

You also can create an Issue if you want to request that i should write about a specific
topic in the future.
